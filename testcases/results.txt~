Comparison of real time of bignumcalc vs bc

For each test case
	Find bignumcalc real time using the command 	-> time bignumcalc in.txt out.txt
	Find bc real time using the command 		-> time bc in_bc.txt > out_bc.txt 2>&1
And report the numbers in the table below. Presently the table has dummy values for timing.
If an error(SynErr,DivErr,SqrtErr,LowPrec) occured in the calculation. Please put Error Occured = 1.
